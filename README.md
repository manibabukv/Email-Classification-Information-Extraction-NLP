# Fetch Data Science Assessment Take-Home Assessment:

Fetch processes and rewards points to its customers for both physical and digital receipts. A customer can snap and upload the picture of physical (paper) receipts to get rewards. They can connect their email account or Amazon account to process digital receipts (eReceipts) and get points. In this exercise we will focus on eReceipt processing.
Task
- When a customer places an order, they receive several emails from the retailers/stores regarding their purchases. Not all of these emails that end up in their inbox are actual eReceipts. Explain your approach on how you would identify which email is a genuine eReceipt and not a shipping update/ marketing email/ refund/ return/ cancellation type email.
- How would you identify and extract the key information of interest from these eReceipts? Key information include but not limited to following: store_name, receipt_date, receipt_subtotal, receipt_total, order_id, product_description, product_quantity, product_price.
Deliverables
Prepare a write up that answers the following:
1. Describe your approach/methodology to solve above mentioned tasks.
2. Description of Machine Learning/Deep Learning algorithms/models and frameworks you would choose.
3. How would you evaluate the proposed solution?
4. Diagrams/reference links etc. (code samples are bonus)
